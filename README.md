# C-Piscine-42-Feb2020

This is the sum up of all the works I did during the C Piscine of February 2020 at School 42.
This work is published under the terms of **[42 Unlicense](https://github.com/gcamerli/42unlicense)**, slightly edited to fit the case of Piscine works.

..* All of the modules code provided here has been deemed worthy of a 100% blessing by the holy Moulinette. All the modules from Shell00 up to C09 plus the C11 module have been completed. C10 is still only very partially done and both C12 and C13 haven't been worked on at all.

..* BSQ is 100% functionnal and passes all the tests provided by our friends from School 19 and available [here](https://github.com/YuuK10/BSQ-tests) but was savagely rejected for a stupid norm error that we overlooked under the pressure of the deadline.

..* Rush00 works almost perfectly and was realised with bonuses but because of a stupid compination of using signed ints starting from 1 and *-or-equal logical operators, there's an infinite loop when int-max is provided as one of the arguments. Easy to correct though.

..* Rush01 has a perfectly working logic and should theoretically work but lack of time prevented us to debug it fully so it's provided in a non-working state.

..* Rush02 suffers from a few memory leaks issues in some functions and has another issue with handling multiple spaces before the ":" in dict lines, but it is working like a charm and is provided with extra dictionnaries and a dirty but functionnal read-from-stdin method.
